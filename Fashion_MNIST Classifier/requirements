Download and import TensorFlow, numpy, and matplotlib.

1. Dataset: is included in Tensorflow/Keras

Fashion MNIST Dataset: A standard dataset for image classification tasks.
Data Preprocessing:
Loading and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets  using load_data.
Normalizing the pixel values to a suitable range (e.g., 0-1).


2. Model Architecture:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A suitable architecture for image classification tasks.
Model Layers:
Convolutional layers to extract features from the images.
Activation functions (ReLU) to introduce non-linearity.
Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and computational cost.
Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D array.
Dense layers for classification - must be the same number as the fashion clusters numbers.


3. Training Process:

Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy loss to measure the difference between predicted and true labels.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer to update the model's weights.
Early Stopping: Implement a custom callback to monitor validation accuracy and stop training when it reaches a certain threshold or starts to degrade (to prevent overfitting).
Model Training: Train the model on the training set, using the specified loss function and optimizer.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing set to assess its performance.


4. Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: Calculate the percentage of correctly classified images.
# Convert predictions to discrete class labels using argmax
# prediction is a matrix of shape (num_samples, num_classes)
# argmax along axis 1 gives the index of the highest probability for each sample
Confusion Matrix: Visualize the model's performance by showing the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. Â  
Classification Report: Provide a detailed report with precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
