if you want to resize the window and image 


#resize window
desired_width = 640
height = 600
cv2.resizeWindow("Image", desired_width, height)

#Use pre-trained model loaded from line Haarcascade_frontalface_defualt.xml
(window size is increased by 10%,
minNeighbors = 4 is minimum number of times a specific pattern needs to be detected within a window to be considered a face) 
4 provides a balance between accuracy and speed. 
then define the rectangle color and thickness'''
